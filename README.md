# Snake Game

This is a recreation of the traditional Snake Game, using Javascript. This was a pretty fun project because it allowed me to know more about vanilla Javascript. I did take some inspiration from [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY). Mostly for the CSS styling since I didn't know how to use CSS Grid. However, de Javascript logic is mine.
